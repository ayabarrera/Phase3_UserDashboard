## Debugging Notes
âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Button was not submitting**  
   **Cause:** `type="submit"` was missing.  
   **Solution:** Added `type="submit"` to the button element.  

2. **Error pushing commits to GitHub**  
   **Cause:** Image file was too large.  
   **Solution:** Resized the image before committing.  

3. **Button hydration issue**  
   **Cause:** Missing `prop-types` dependency.  
   **Solution:** Installed `prop-types`.  

4. **Navbar links were broken**  
   **Cause:** Incorrect rendering logic.  
   **Solution:** Fixed link rendering per page.  

5. **NavLinks breaking at screen width < 600px**  
   **Cause:** Responsive styling issue.  
   **Solution:** Implemented a burger menu for smaller screens.
